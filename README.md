# Convolutional-Neural-Network-for-Medical-Imaging-Analysis

## Abnormality detection in mammography
### Antonio Acquavia
### Matilde Mazzini

Group project for the Computational Intelligence and Deep Learning course at University of Pisa.

The aim of this project is to solve, using deep neural networks, two breast
cancer classification problems:
• Benignant-Malignant classification
• Mass-Calcification classification

Dataset used:  modified CBIS DDSM (Curated Breast Imaging Subset of
Digital Database for Screening Mammography).
